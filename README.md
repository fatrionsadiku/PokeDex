  - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): for dependency injection.
  - [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore): Data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers
- Architecture
- MVVM Architecture (View - DataBinding - ViewModel - Model)
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit): Construct the REST APIs and paging network data.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide), [GlidePalette](https://github.com/florent37/GlidePalette): Loading images from network.
- [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil), [CoilSVG](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/svgs/): Loading SVG's from network.
- [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android): JSON-based animation file format that allows you to ship animations on any platform as easily as shipping static assets.
